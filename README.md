# Filter-Modeling-Simulation
This "educational" repository presents the modeling and simulation of low-pass, high-pass, lead-lag and other filters, defined by their LAPLACE transfer function. 

After a brief review of the theory, examples will be presented using software tools such as PYTHON, SCILAB, MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, MAPLE, OPEN MODELICA, LTSpice and even EXCEL (non exhaustive list).
A short presentation of State Space Modeling will be done with examples and more specifically with OPEN MODELICA custom blocks.

_Therefore the highlight of this blog is  to present concrete examples of how softwares (like Matlab, Scilab, Python, etc.) can be used to model and simulate analog filters. Various examples are depicted so that it's possible to compare the different software approaches._

Sampled filters are not covered in this blog (maybe in a future extension).
