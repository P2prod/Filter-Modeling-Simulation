# Filter-Modeling-Simulation
This educational repository presents the modeling and simulation of low-pass, high-pass, lead-lag and other filters, defined by their LAPLACE transfer function. 

After a brief review of the theory, examples will be presented using software tools such as PYTHON, SCILAB, MATLAB, MATHEMATICA, MAPLE, OPEN MODELICA, LTSpice and even EXCEL (non exhaustive list).
A short presentation of State Space Modeling will be done with examples and more specifically with OPEN MODELICA custom blocks.
